                The national color of Qatar is an exotic maroon visualized by the exact color of this text that is highlighted on its national flag.
                It originates from the purple dye industry that Qatar is known for throughout its history, 
                as well as differentiating itself from the usual flag colors such as black and red usually seen throughout the region.

                Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, uses a very rich green visualized by the exact color of this text for its iconic flag color 
                due to its association with Islam and the various empires that governed the Arabian Peninsula over the centuries.
