    <h1 style="color: darkgreen; font-style: italic; text-align: center;">National Colors of Qatar vs Saudi Arabia</h1>
    
    <h2>Qatar's National Color</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 105%; color: rgb(138, 21, 56);">
        The national color of Qatar is an exotic maroon that is highlighted on its national flag.
        It originates from the purple dye industry that Qatar is known for throughout its history, 
        as well as differentiating itself from the usual flag colors such as black and red usually seen throughout the region.
        This paragraph demonstrates <strong>inheritance</strong>: Since the font family is set in the <body>, it applies here automatically.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Saudi Arabia's National Color</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 105%; color: rgb(0, 84, 48);">
        Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, uses a very rich green for its iconic flag color 
        due to its association with Islam and the various empires that governed the Arabian Peninsula over the centuries.

      Chapter 10 Concept: Cascade and Specificity
      The styles applied in external, internal, and inline CSS demonstrate how cascade rules prioritize them.
      Here, inline styles on <h1> override internal/external styles, while internal styles apply when no inline styles exist.
    -->
    <footer>
        <p>Even though Saudi Arabia and Qatar use vastly different colors to contrast the white color on both of their flags, 
        they both look equally beautiful in real life.</p>
