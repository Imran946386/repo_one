        <h1>Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani</h1>
        <p>
            For my second homework assignment, I decided to make a short biography for Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, 
            the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs for the State of Qatar. Sheikh Mohammed has been at the forefront of 
            solving and mediating various conflicts and disputes, not just in the region but across the world. My goal is to showcase 
            his background and expertise in foreign affairs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sheikh Mohammed was born on November 1, 1980, in Qatar's capital city, Doha. He earned his bachelor's degree in economics 
            and business administration from the College of Business and Economics at Qatar University in 2003. After graduation, he served 
            in various positions across multiple ministries and organizations in Qatar, such as the Ruling Family Council and the Economic 
            Affairs Council, before officially joining the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 2013. Below are his current positions, foreign 
            honors, and some of his famous quotes while serving under the current Emir, Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani.
