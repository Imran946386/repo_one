            <h2>Ferrari F430 Overview</h2> 
            <p>The Ferrari F430 was Ferrari's mainstream 8 cylinder sports car that ran from model years 2005 to 2010. 
               The reason why I chose the Ferrari F430 specifically because it is now starting to become more appreciated for being the last Ferrari that came with a manual transmission, 
               which is something that many car enthusiasts are starting to appreciate more and more. This is in contrast to the 458 model that succeeded it having no manual option while having a major power increase compared to its predecessor the 360.

            <h2>Ferrari F430 Specifications</h2> 
            <p>The Ferrari F430 is powered by a naturally aspirated 4.3 Liter V8 producing 483 horsepower and 343 pound feet of torque.
                It is mated to either a 6 speed manual or a 6 speed F1 dual clutch automatic transmission. 
                The car weighs around 3,300 pounds and can go from 0-60 in around 4 seconds with a top speed of 196 miles per hour. 
                It also came in two body styles, a coupe and a spider as well as a Scuderia version later on which had more power and less weight.
